# MoVerify - Remote Identity Proofing App

## Overview

This Flutter-based mobile application provides a robust and secure remote identity proofing solution. It leverages advanced technologies to verify user identities through various methods, ensuring a high level of accuracy and security.

## Features

- **Document Verification**: Scan and verify government-issued IDs such as passports, driver's licenses, and national identity cards.
- **Liveness Detection**: Ensure the person is physically present during the verification process.
- **Facial Recognition**: Match the user's face with the photo on their ID.
- **Fingerprint Scanning**: Capture and verify fingerprints for additional security.
- **OTP Verification**: Implement two-factor authentication using SMS-based one-time passwords.
- **Background Check**: Perform comprehensive internet searches to verify the user's online presence and cross-reference provided information.
- **User Dashboard**: Provide a clean, intuitive interface for users to manage their verification status and documents.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform framework for building the mobile application
- **Dart**: Programming language used with Flutter
- **Firebase**: Backend services for authentication and data storage
- **Google ML Kit**: For document scanning and facial recognition
- **Custom Web Scraping**: For background checks and online presence verification

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/remote-identity-proofing-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd remote-identity-proofing-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

## Configuration

1. Set up a Firebase project and add your `google-services.json` file to the `android/app` directory.
2. Configure your API keys in the `lib/config/api_keys.dart` file (create this file if it doesn't exist):
   ```dart
   const String FIREBASE_API_KEY = 'your_firebase_api_key';
   const String SMS_GATEWAY_API_KEY = 'your_sms_gateway_api_key';
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the app and create an account.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the identity verification process:
   - Upload a photo of your government-issued ID
   - Complete the liveness detection check
   - Scan your fingerprint (if available on your device)
   - Verify your phone number with an OTP
3. Wait for the background check to complete.
4. Once verified, you can use your account to access secure services.

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- Biometric data is processed on-device and not stored on our servers.
- Regular security audits are conducted to ensure the integrity of the system.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with blockchain for decentralized identity verification
- AI-powered document forgery detection
- Enhanced background check algorithms using machine learning
- Support for additional types of identity documents
